Individual Prototype repository
I am providing the main database schema and implementation of procedures for the Cancellation Test.
In my individual prototype I create several tables and store procedures as well as a test script for using and displaying the results
of said store procedures. Although this is my main role i look foward to aiding in other aspects of the implementation like making the app
and website look aesthetically pleasing. This is something I really want to learn.
